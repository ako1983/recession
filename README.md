# When's The Next Recession?

In the Treasury market, shorter-term interest rates this week started to move above some longer-term rates.

That can be an early warning sign of a recession, as it was in 1990, 2001 and 2007, according to a study by Bespoke. The firm said that kind of bond market move may indicate that some of the more widely watched spreads could also soon flip, or invert, a precursor to a recession.

The 3-year Treasury yield Monday moved above the 5-year yield, and it was soon followed by the 2-year. The market most closely watches the spread between the 2-year and 10-year, as well as 3-month to 10-year spread, which is the one preferred by the Fed.
